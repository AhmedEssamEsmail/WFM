### Recent Improvements (February 2026)

#### Audit-Driven Improvements (February 2026)
Following a comprehensive codebase audit, we implemented critical security, architecture, and code quality improvements:

**Security Enhancements**:
- **Hardened Content Security Policy**: Removed `unsafe-eval` from CSP directives in production deployment
- **Proper Sentry Integration**: Migrated from `(window as any).Sentry` to official `@sentry/react` SDK with proper initialization
- **Environment Variable Security**: Removed hardcoded test keys from `.env.example`, replaced with secure placeholders
- **Service Layer Validation**: All data-fetching now goes through service layer with React Query hooks

**Architecture Improvements**:
- **Component Decomposition**: Split large components for better maintainability
  - Settings page (701 lines) → 5 focused sub-components (~80-150 lines each)
  - Reports page (462 lines) → 5 focused sub-components with dedicated data hook
  - Dashboard data-fetching extracted to `useDashboardData` hook
- **Unified Data-Fetching Strategy**: All pages now use React Query hooks with service layer (no direct Supabase imports in components)
- **Consolidated Validation**: New `src/validation/` module with Zod schemas as single source of truth
  - Organized schemas: `common.ts`, `user.ts`, `leaveRequest.ts`, `swapRequest.ts`, `breakSchedule.ts`, `settings.ts`
  - Derived imperative validators from Zod schemas
  - Eliminated scattered validation logic across 4+ locations
- **Fully Dynamic Leave Types**: Removed hardcoded `LeaveType` union, now loads from database at runtime
- **Service Layer Completeness**: All services properly exported from barrel file

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- **Package Naming**: Renamed from "swaptool" to "wfm" for consistency
- **Clean Codebase**: Removed AI-generated scaffold comments and leftover instructions
- **Unified Constants**: All localStorage keys now defined in `constants/index.ts` (no inline strings)
- **Route Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `/new` routes, kept canonical `/create` paths
- **Conditional DevTools**: React Query DevTools only load in development mode
- **404 Page**: Added dedicated NotFound page instead of silent redirects
- **Build Artifacts**: Added `coverage/` to `.gitignore` for cleaner repository

**Testing & CI Improvements**:
- **Optimized CI Pipeline**: Merged duplicate test runs (was running tests twice), now single `test:coverage` step
- **Test Count Accuracy**: Corrected documentation to reflect actual test count (568 tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Added comprehensive approval workflow tests

**UI/UX Polish**:
- **Icon Organization**: Extracted 12+ inline SVG icons to dedicated `src/components/icons/` directory
- **Configurable Email Domain**: Email domain now loads from `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` environment variable
- **Enhanced Supabase Client**: Configured auth persistence, auto-refresh, and retry options

## Approval Workflows

### Leave Requests

```
Agent submits leave request
  └─→ Balance check
        ├─→ Sufficient balance: Status: pending_tl
        │     └─→ TL approves
        │           └─→ Status: pending_wfm (or approved if auto-approve enabled)
        │                 └─→ WFM approves
        │                       └─→ Status: approved (balance deducted)
        │
        └─→ Insufficient balance: Status: denied
              └─→ If exceptions allowed: Agent can request exception
                    └─→ Follows normal approval workflow
```

### Swap Requests

```
Agent requests swap
  └─→ Status: pending_acceptance
        └─→ Target user accepts
              └─→ Status: pending_tl
                    └─→ TL approves
                          └─→ Status: pending_wfm (or approved if auto-approve enabled)
                                └─→ WFM approves
                                      └─→ Status: approved (shifts swapped)
```

*At any step, the approver can reject the request, setting the status to `rejected` or `denied`.*

## Architecture Principles

### Component Decomposition

Large components have been split into focused, single-responsibility modules:

**Settings Page** (was 701 lines → now 5 components):
- `index.tsx` - Tab navigation shell (~80 lines)
- `GeneralSettings.tsx` - Auto-approve and exceptions toggles (~80 lines)
- `LeaveTypeManager.tsx` - Leave type CRUD operations (~150 lines)
- `BreakScheduleSettings.tsx` - Break schedule configuration (~100 lines)
- `ShiftConfigSettings.tsx` - Shift configuration (~100 lines)

**Reports Page** (was 462 lines → now 5 components + hook):
- `index.tsx` - Layout orchestrator (~60 lines)
- `ReportFilters.tsx` - Date range selector (~60 lines)
- `MetricCards.tsx` - Summary cards (~80 lines)
- `SwapChart.tsx` - Swap bar chart (~60 lines)
- `LeaveChart.tsx` - Leave pie chart (~60 lines)
- `useReportData.ts` - Data fetching hook (~80 lines)

**Dashboard Page** (was 284 lines → extracted hook):
- `Dashboard.tsx` - UI component
- `useDashboardData.ts` - Data fetching logic

### Unified Data-Fetching Strategy

All data-fetching follows a consistent pattern:

```
Component → React Query Hook → Service Layer → Supabase
```

**Rules**:
- No components import `supabase` directly
- All data-fetching wrapped in React Query hooks
- Service layer handles all database operations
- Consistent error handling and loading states

**Benefits**:
- Automatic caching and background refetching
- Request deduplication
- Optimistic updates
- Better testability
- Consistent error handling

### Service Layer Pattern

All services follow a consistent structure:

```typescript
// services/exampleService.ts
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

export const exampleService = {
  async getItems() {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('table')
      .select('*');
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },
  
  async createItem(item: Item) {
    // Validation at service layer
    validateItem(item);
    
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('table')
      .insert(item)
      .select()
      .single();
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  }
};
```

All services are exported from `services/index.ts` for easy imports.

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- All heavy pages lazy loaded for faster initial load
- Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
- Reduced initial bundle size by ~40%

### Build Optimizations

- Terser minification with console removal in production
- Vendor chunks separated (React, Supabase, React Query, date-fns)

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Service worker for offline support
- Automatic asset caching
- Installable on mobile and desktop
- Network-first strategy for API calls

### React Performance
- Memoized callbacks and expensive computations
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Optimized re-renders with useMemo and useCallback
- React Query DevTools conditionally loaded (development only)

### Performance Utilities
- Debounce and throttle functions
- Intersection Observer for lazy loading
- Local storage with cross-tab sync
- Centralized error handling

### Project Organization Rules

Following the February 2026 restructure, the codebase follows clear organization rules:

**Component Organization:**
- **Threshold:** 3+ related files = subdirectory with `index.tsx`
- **Flat files:** Single components stay in `src/components/`
- **Shared directory:** Infrastructure components (Layout, ErrorBoundary, ProtectedRoute, etc.)
- **Feature directories:** BreakSchedule, Headcount, OvertimeRequests, Skills (all meet threshold)

**Page Organization:**
- **Threshold:** 2+ related pages = subdirectory with `index.ts`
- **Flat files:** Single pages stay in `src/pages/`
- **All page directories** have index files for cleaner imports

**Documentation:**
- **Root:** Only essential config and primary README
- **docs/:** All documentation files
- **docs/project-tracking/:** Project management documents (moved from root)

**Benefits:**
- Predictable structure with clear rules
- Easy to locate and delete features
- Cleaner imports with barrel exports
- Scales naturally as project grows── leaveRequest.ts      # Leave request schemas

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Pushes to `main` branch

**Jobs**:
1. **Build** - TypeScript compilation and Vite build
2. **Lint** - ESLint code quality checks
3. **Test & Coverage** - Single optimized test run with coverage report (no duplicate test execution)

**Artifacts**:
- Build artifacts (7 days retention)
- Lint reports (30 days retention)
- Coverage reports (30 days retention)

### Branch Protection

Recommended branch protection rules for `main`:
- Require CI checks to pass before merge
- Require pull request reviews (1 approver)
- Prevent force pushes
- Require linear history

### Deployment Pipeline

**Vercel Deployment**:
- Automatic deployment on push to `main`
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

---

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for **Vercel** deployment with:
- SPA rewrite rules (all routes redirect to index.html)
- Security headers:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevents clickjacking)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (prevents MIME sniffing)

**Deploy to Vercel:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Deploy

The `vercel.json` configuration handles all routing automatically.

---

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth** with email/password authentication
- Email domain validation (`@dabdoob.com` only)
- Automatic session management and token refresh
- User-friendly error messages for auth failures

### Database Security
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies on all tables
- Role-based access control at the database level
- Secure user profile creation via database triggers
- Audit logging for sensitive operations (headcount changes)

### Frontend Security
- Role-based route guards (ProtectedRoute, WFMOnlyRoute, HeadcountRoute)
- Protected component wrappers for sensitive actions
- Only public/anon keys exposed to client (no service role keys)
- Canonical routes with 404 page for invalid paths (no silent redirects)
- Removed duplicate routes for cleaner URL structure

### Deployment Security
- Security headers via Vercel configuration:
  - **Hardened Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Removed `unsafe-eval`, restricted script sources
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevents clickjacking)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (prevents MIME sniffing)
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (controls referrer information)
- HTTPS enforced on production
- Environment variables secured in Vercel dashboard
- **Sentry Integration**: Production error tracking with `@sentry/react` SDK
  - Proper initialization with DSN and environment configuration
  - Automatic error capture and performance monitoring
  - Sourcemap upload for better debugging

## Key Features Implementation

### February 2026 Audit Improvements Summary

Following a comprehensive codebase audit, we implemented 47 improvements across 6 priority levels:

**Completed (P0-P2 - Critical to Medium)**:
- ✅ 12 Security improvements (hardened CSP, proper Sentry integration, secure env vars)
- ✅ 10 Architecture improvements (component decomposition, unified data-fetching, consolidated validation)
- ✅ 8 Code quality improvements (package naming, clean code, unified constants, conditional DevTools)
- ✅ 2 Testing improvements (optimized CI pipeline, accurate test counts)
- ✅ 3 UX polish items (icon extraction, configurable email domain, enhanced Supabase client)

**Optional (P3-P5 - Lower Priority)**:
- 🔄 Database migration renumbering (works but inconsistent)
- 🔄 Security audit trail server-side (currently localStorage)
- 🔄 Additional test coverage (25.89% → 70% target)
- 🔄 PWA icon additions (192×192, 512×512)

**Impact**:
- Improved security posture with hardened CSP and proper error tracking
- Better maintainability with decomposed components (701 lines → 5 focused components)
- Consistent data-fetching pattern across all pages
- Single source of truth for validation (Zod schemas)
- Faster CI pipeline (eliminated duplicate test runs)
- Cleaner codebase (removed scaffold comments, unified naming)

### Auto-Approve Workflow
When enabled in Settings, requests automatically move from `pending_tl` → `approved` after TL approval, bypassing WFM approval step.

### Leave Balance Validation
- Automatic balance check before leave request submission
- Auto-denial for insufficient balance (status: `denied`)
- Optional exception request flow when enabled in Settings
- Balance deduction upon final approval

### Swap Request Original Shift Tracking
Stores all 4 shift types involved in a swap:
- Requester's original shift on their date
- Requester's original shift on target's date
- Target's original shift on their date
- Target's original shift on requester's date

This allows displaying complete swap history even after shifts are modified.

### Bulk Import Features
- **Schedule Upload**: CSV import for bulk shift assignments (WFM only)
- **Leave Balance Upload**: CSV import for bulk balance updates (WFM only)
- **Employee Import**: CSV import for bulk headcount updates (WFM only)

All imports include validation, error reporting, and rollback on failure.

## Validation Architecture

The application uses a **consolidated validation system** built on Zod schemas as the single source of truth.

### Structure

```
src/validation/
├── index.ts                    # Barrel exports for all validators
├── validators.ts               # Imperative validators derived from Zod
├── leaveBalanceValidation.ts   # Leave balance business logic
└── schemas/                    # Zod schemas (single source of truth)
    ├── common.ts               # UUID, date, email, pagination schemas
    ├── user.ts                 # User profile and role schemas
    ├── leaveRequest.ts         # Leave request validation schemas
    ├── swapRequest.ts          # Swap request validation schemas
    ├── breakSchedule.ts        # Break schedule validation schemas
    └── settings.ts             # Settings validation schemas
```

### Key Features

- **Zod-First Approach**: All validation rules defined as Zod schemas
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types automatically inferred from schemas
- **Reusable Schemas**: Common patterns (UUID, date ranges, enums) defined once
- **Imperative Validators**: Derived from Zod schemas for backward compatibility
- **Centralized Location**: All validation logic in one place (`src/validation/`)
- **Service Layer Integration**: Validation enforced at service layer to prevent API bypass

### Common Schemas

```typescript
// UUID validation
uuidSchema: z.string().uuid()

// Date validation
dateSchema: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/)

// Email validation
emailSchema: z.string().email()

// Enum validation (role, status, shift type, etc.)
roleSchema: z.enum(['agent', 'tl', 'wfm'])
```

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { leaveRequestSchema, validateLeaveRequest } from '@/validation';

// Zod schema validation
const result = leaveRequestSchema.safeParse(data);

// Imperative validation (backward compatible)
const isValid = validateLeaveRequest(data);
```

## Design System

The application uses a **unified design system** (`src/lib/designSystem.ts`) for consistent styling across all components.

### Color Palette
Custom blue primary color palette based on Tailwind's blue scale:

| Shade | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| primary-50 | `#eff6ff` | Lightest backgrounds |
| primary-100 | `#dbeafe` | Light backgrounds |
| primary-200 | `#bfdbfe` | Subtle borders |
| primary-300 | `#93c5fd` | Disabled states |
| primary-400 | `#60a5fa` | Hover states |
| primary-500 | `#3b82f6` | Default primary |
| primary-600 | `#2563eb` | Primary buttons |
| primary-700 | `#1d4ed8` | Active states |
| primary-800 | `#1e40af` | Dark accents |
| primary-900 | `#1e3a8a` | Darkest accents |

### Semantic Colors
Consistent color system for different states:
- **Success**: Green (`bg-green-100`, `text-green-800`)
- **Error**: Red (`bg-red-100`, `text-red-800`)
- **Warning**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100`, `text-yellow-800`)
- **Info**: Blue (`bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`)
- **Neutral**: Gray (`bg-gray-100`, `text-gray-800`)

### Shift Type Colors
- **AM**: Blue (`bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`)
- **PM**: Purple (`bg-purple-100`, `text-purple-800`)
- **BET**: Orange (`bg-orange-100`, `text-orange-800`)
- **OFF**: Gray (`bg-gray-100`, `text-gray-800`)

### Leave Type Colors
- **Sick**: Red with border (`bg-red-100`, `text-red-800`, `border-red-300`)
- **Annual**: Green with border (`bg-green-100`, `text-green-800`, `border-green-300`)
- **Casual**: Yellow with border (`bg-yellow-100`, `text-yellow-800`, `border-yellow-300`)
- **Public Holiday**: Indigo with border (`bg-indigo-100`, `text-indigo-800`, `border-indigo-300`)
- **Bereavement**: Gray with border (`bg-gray-200`, `text-gray-800`, `border-gray-400`)

### Status Colors
- **Pending Acceptance**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100`, `text-yellow-800`)
- **Pending TL**: Blue (`bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`)
- **Pending WFM**: Purple (`bg-purple-100`, `text-purple-800`)
- **Approved**: Green (`bg-green-100`, `text-green-800`)
- **Rejected**: Red (`bg-red-100`, `text-red-800`)
- **Denied**: Orange (`bg-orange-100`, `text-orange-800`)

### Role Colors
- **Agent**: Blue (`bg-blue-100`, `text-blue-800`)
- **Team Lead**: Green (`bg-green-100`, `text-green-800`)
- **WFM**: Purple (`bg-purple-100`, `text-purple-800`)

### Reusable Components
The design system includes pre-defined styles for:
- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, ghost, link
- **Badges**: Default, large, small sizes
- **Cards**: Default, hover, bordered, flat
- **Inputs**: Default, error, disabled states

### Helper Functions
- `getStatusColor()` - Get color class for any request status
- `getStatusLabel()` - Get label for any request status
- `getShiftColor()` - Get color class for shift types
- `getLeaveColor()` - Get color class for leave types
- `getRoleColor()` - Get color class for user roles
- `cn()` - Combine class names utility

### Typography
- Font Family: System font stack (default Tailwind)
- Headings: Bold weight with appropriate sizing
- Body: Regular weight, comfortable line height
